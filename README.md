## About

A Python package providing various parsers to read and write various types of files used in the models developed at [ACCESS-NRI](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI).

## Key Features

- Parsers for configuration files used across ACCESS-NRI models
- Support for round-trip parsing, preserving comments and formatting
- Simple API

## Documentation

Coming soon.

## Installation

### Using pip

You can install the latest release directly from PyPI:
'''shell
pip install access-parsers
'''

### From source

If you prefer to install from source:
'''shell
git clone https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-parsers.git
cd access-parsers
pip install .
'''

## Usage

Here is a simple example of how to parse a text and modify its contents.

To parse some text, one just needs to call the `parse` function of the appropriate parser:
'''python
from access.parsers import FortranNMLParser

text = '''&data_nml
 parameterA = 1
 parameterB = 'abc'
/'''

config = FortranNMLParser().parse(text)
print(config)
'''
'''python
&data_nml
parameterA = 1
parameterB = 'abc'
/
'''

The parsed content can then be modified just like any Python dict:
'''python
config["data_nml"]["parameterA"] = 2
print(config)
'''
'''python
&data_nml
parameterA = 2
parameterB = 'abc'
/
'''

## Development installation

If you intend to contribute or modify the package, it is recommended to work inside a virtual environment.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment
'''shell
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
'''

2. Install in editable mode with development and test dependencies
'''shell
pip install -e ".[devel,test]"
'''
This will install the package in editable mode, meaning changes to the source code are reflected immediately without reinstallation. Development dependencies such as testing tools will also be installed.

3. Run the test suite
'''shell
pytest
'''
